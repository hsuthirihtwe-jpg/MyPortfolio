    Hi! I’m Hsu Thiri Htwe, a curious learner with a strong foundation in science and computer studies. I’ve completed my GED and High School Diploma from Myanmar, and I’m certified in English through the Duolingo English Test.<br><br>
    I’m passionate about exploring technology, solving problems, and turning ideas into practical solutions. I also enjoy teaching basic computer skills and sharing knowledge with others, which has helped me develop strong communication and teamwork skills. I’m excited to continue learning, growing, and contributing in fields that challenge me and inspire creativity.

        <h3>🤹 Here Comes Volunteering… Without a Certificate!</h3>
        <p>
            I started volunteering back in 2019 in my city, Lashio, right when COVID-19 began.  
            Balancing online classes for Grade 10 with helping out in my community was challenging but rewarding.  

            In 2021, when the military conflict disrupted life in Myanmar, I had to make tough decisions and quit volunteering.  
            Unfortunately, I couldn’t get a formal certificate for my volunteer work, but the experience taught me valuable lessons in resilience, teamwork, and helping others even in difficult times.
